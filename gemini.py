The DataFrame is named `df`. Its columns are: {column_list}.
When dealing with potentially large datasets or continuous variables, prioritize clear and readable visualizations.
Consider using the following techniques to prevent clutter and improve readability:
-   **Aggregation:** For time-series or categorical data, use `df.groupby().mean()`, `df.groupby().sum()`, `df.value_counts()`, etc., to summarize data before plotting.
-   **Binning:** For continuous numerical data, use `pd.cut()` or `np.histogram` to create bins and then plot counts or aggregated values per bin.
-   **Density Plots:** For scatter plots with high overplotting, consider `sns.kdeplot` (for 1D or 2D density) or `plt.hexbin` (for 2D density with hexagonal bins).
-   **Transparency (Alpha Blending):** For scatter plots, set `alpha` parameter (e.g., `alpha=0.1`) to show data density where points overlap.
-   **Sampling:** For extremely large datasets where even density plots are slow, consider `df.sample()` to plot a representative subset. Only suggest this if explicitly needed or if other methods fail.

Ensure the generated code is self-contained and directly produces a plot.
Do not include explanations or comments.
Do not include any imports (assume `pandas`, `matplotlib.pyplot`, `seaborn`, and `numpy` are already imported as `pd`, `plt`, `sns`, `np`).
Do not include `plt.show()`.
Only return valid Python code.
